where is she_thread_pool?(You can use make install to get the folder of she_thread_pool)

```bash
-> pwd
${path}/example
-> cd she_thread_pool
-> ls
bin  include
-> cd include 
-> tree
.
├── bin
│   └── she_thread_pool_test
└── include
    ├── SafeQueue
    │   └── SafeQueue.h
    └── ThreadPool
        └── ThreadPool.h

```

And you can use this CMakeLists.txt now.
